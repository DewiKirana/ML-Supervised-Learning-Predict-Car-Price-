# ML-Supervised-Learning-Predict-Car-Price-
This project is describing about  data understanding and data Preparation for Autombile dataset for predict car price.
This project also looking for information about the impact of fuels on the car prices.
For modelling is used : Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree.
The best modelling for predict the price of car is  with Decisison Tree because it has the best evaluation matrix.
Hyperparameter tunning is performed on Random Forest and Decision Tree model with Random Search method.
